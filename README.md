This is an example website incorporating some html5, css, jquery and angularjs code. The website uses the ESPN api to return top news articles related to my three favorite sports teams (Syracuse Orange, NY Jets and Buffalo Sabres). I incorporated some outside code which I've recentely come across and wanted to try implementing on my own, specifically the overlay menu affect which I saw on <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/02/06/fullscreen-overlay-effects/">tympanus.net/codrops</a>. If I was to expand this site further my next steps would be creating a more extensive list of teams and leagues, as well as incorporating more of the api results onto the page. 

The site is currently hosted via AWS, and can be visited at <a href="http://sitetest01.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/home.html">Phil's Favorite Teams</a>
