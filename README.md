This is an example website incorporating some css and angular code (not in there yet) which I have been tinkering with lately. The website uses the ESPN api to return top news articles related to my three favorite sports teams.

The site is currently hosted via AWS, and can be visited at <a href="http://sitetest01.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/home.html">Phil's Favorite Teams</a>
